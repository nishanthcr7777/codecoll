## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aiarena.git
cd aiarena
```

### 2. Install dependencies

The project uses **pnpm**. If you don't have it:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY
GEMINI_API_KEY
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

> **Security tip:** never commit real API keys to version control. The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env.local`.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown) in your browser. Hot-reloading is enabled out of the box.

### 5. Build for production

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

The app will be served from `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## 🧪 Testing

(Currently no automated tests.) Feel free to contribute unit/integration tests using Jest, Vitest or Playwright.

## 🖌️ Styling & Components

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and Radix primitives. Utility classes are composed using **tailwind-merge** and **class-variance-authority** for variant support.
